## Announcement

* Profiler [2.3.1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Profiler.AspNetCore/2.3.1) is released.
  * Highlights:
    * First stable version runs on .NET 6: some edge cases covered by betas. Thank you all for early adoption and the bug reports.
    * Smaller package - Compare to 2.3.0, down to around 7M from 12M, thanks to the unified uploader across all .NET runtime versions.
    * Bump up Microsoft.Extensions packages to 3.1.22 for security.

## Description

This is the project home page for `Microsoft Application Insights Profiler for ASP.NET Core`. The NuGet packages can be found [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Profiler.AspNetCore/).

## Get Started

* Create an application

```shell
dotnet new webapi
```

* Add NuGet packages

```shell
dotnet add package Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore
dotnet add package Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Profiler.AspNetCore
```

_Notice: .NET Core 2.2 is **out of support**, it is recommended to migrate your project to .NET Core 3.1/6.0. Refer to [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) page for details. If you have to stay on .NET Core 2.2 for now, please this specific version of [`Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore v2.14`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore/2.14.0) alone with the profiler package._

_Tips: Find official migration documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/22-to-30?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio)._

* Enable Application Insights Profiler

Open [Startup.cs](./examples/QuickStart3_0/Startup.cs)

```csharp
using System.Diagnostics;
...
// This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    ...
    // Adding the following lines to enable application insights and profiler.
    services.AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry();
    services.AddServiceProfiler();
}
```

* Add a bottleneck

To make it real, make use the following code to add some delay in the [WeatherForecastController.cs](examples/QuickStart3_0/Controllers/WeatherForecastController.cs) to simulate the bottleneck:

```csharp
using System.Threading;
...
private static void SimulateDelay()
{
    // Delay for 200ms to 5s to simulate a bottleneck.
    Thread.Sleep((new Random()).Next(200, 5000));
}
```

And call it from the controller methods:

```csharp
[HttpGet]
public IEnumerable<WeatherForecast> Get()
{
    SimulateDelay();
    var rng = new Random();
    return Enumerable.Range(1, 5).Select(index => new WeatherForecast
    ...
}
```

* Setup the instrumentation key for debugging

In [appsettings.Development.json](examples/QuickStart3_0/appsettings.Development.json), add the following configuration:

```jsonc
{
    ...
    "ApplicationInsights": {
        "InstrumentationKey": "replace-with-your-instrumentation-key"
    }
    ...
}
```

* Alternatively, use a connection string like in [QuickStart3.1 example](./examples/QuickStart3_1/appsettings.Development.json).

* Run the WebAPI, generate traffic for profiling

To run your application locally:

```shell
dotnet run
```

At the beginning of the application, **OneTimeSchedulingPolicy** will immediately kick in, profiling for 2 minutes. Hit the endpoint in a browser during the profiling session in your browser:

```url
https://localhost:5001/weatherforecast
```

* Analyze the trace from Azure Portal

Get a coffee and wait for a couple of minutes - the backend needs some time, usually a 2 minutes, to ingest the data.

Then, open the application insights resource in Azure Portal, go to the **performance** blade, and use the button of `Configure Profiler`. There, you are going to see all profiling sessions:

_Tip: Click on the trace to open the trace analyzer._
